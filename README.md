# Babel-Fish-with-LLM-STT-TTS


Welcome to this guided project on creating a Babel Fish. Babel Fish is a metaphor for a translation service or a tool - based on a fictional creature from Douglas Adams' "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" series.

In this project, you will create a voice translation assistant using Watsonx and IBM Watson Speech Libraries for Embed. The guided project takes you through building a translation assistant that can take voice input, convert it to text using speech-to-text technology, send the text to Watsonx's flan-ul2 model, receive a response in other languages, convert it to speech using text-to-speech technology and finally play it back to the user. The voice translator will have a responsive frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a reliable backend using Flask.

Click here to play with a demo of the final application that you will create!

By the end of the course, you will have the skills to create your own AI-powered translation assistant capable of receiving voice input and providing translations in various languages. You will also have a solid foundation in web development using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with a fully functional full-stack application that is certain to impress anyone who interacts with it!

Before we begin, let's give some context of each topic.

Watsonx
Watsonx is an AI and data platform with a set of AI assistants designed to help you scale and accelerate the impact of AI with trusted data across your business.

The core components include a studio for new foundation models, generative AI, and machine learning; a fit-for-purpose data store built on an open data lakehouse architecture; and a toolkit, to accelerate AI workflows that are built with responsibility, transparency, and explainability.

The Watsonx AI assistants empower individuals in your organization to do work without expert knowledge across a variety of business processes and applications, including automating customer service, generating code, and automating key workflows in departments such as HR.

IBM Watson Speech Libraries for Embed
IBM Watson® Speech Libraries for Embed is a set of containerized text-to-speech and speech-to-text libraries designed to offer our IBM partners greater flexibility to infuse the best of IBM Research® technology into their solutions. Now available as embeddable AI, partners gain greater capabilities to build voice transcription and voice synthesis applications more quickly and deploy them in any hybrid multi-cloud environment. These technologies allow the assistant to communicate with users through voice input and output.

Voice assistants
A virtual assistant is a program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the Internet using natural human voice. Assistants can be used in a variety of industries, including customer service, e-commerce, and education.

Python (Flask)
Python is a popular programming language that is widely used in web development and data science. Flask is a web framework for Python that makes it easy to build web applications. We will be using Python and Flask to build the backend of our voice assistant. Python is a powerful language that is easy to learn and has a large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that can be leveraged in projects like ours.

HTML - CSS - JavaScript
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to structure content on the web. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used to add interactivity to web pages. Together, these technologies allow us to build a visually appealing and interactive frontend for our assistant. Users will be able to interact with the voice assistant through a web interface that's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Learning objectives
At the end of this project, you will be able to:

Explain the basics of voice assistants and their various applications
Set up a development environment for building an assistant using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Implement speech-to-text functionality to allow the assistant to understand voice input from users
Integrate the assistant with Watsonx's flan-ul2 model to give it a high level of intelligence and the ability to understand and respond to user requests
Implement text-to-speech functionality to allow the assistant to communicate with users through voice output
Combine all of the above components to create a functional assistant that can take voice input and provide a spoken response
Deploy as web application by running a server in development mode
Prerequisites
For working on this project, you should have a fundamental knowledge of Python. In addition, having knowledge of the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are nice to have but not essential. We will do our best in explaining each step of the process as well as any code shown along the way.
